Production Shading Library

The Shading Library refers to Laika's entire collection of production shading capabilities. These are embodied primarily in the set of Shading Library files. These are stored and versioned through git repositories that contain the production and development branches.

This repository will contain those portions of Laika's Production Shading Library that have been released as open source.
