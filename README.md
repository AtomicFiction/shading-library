Production Shading Library

The Production Shading Library refers to [Laika's](https://www.laika.com) entire collection of VFX production shading capabilities. These are embodied primarily in the set of shading library files.

This repository will contain those portions of Laika's Production Shading Library that have been released as open source.

The inagural release contains a set of shading nodes that provide a Material Layering System based on [Pixar's](https://www.pixar.com) [RenderMan 22](https://renderman.pixar.com/product).

## Requirements
* Pixar's RenderMan 22
* Pixar's RenderMan 22 for Katana 3.0
* [Foundry's](https://www.foundry.com) [Katana 3.0](https://www.foundry.com/products/katana)
* A c++11 compatible compiler

An update of the Material Layering System that includes support for Maya 2018 will come soon.
